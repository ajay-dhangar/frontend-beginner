## Day 2: Working with Git Basics

In this lesson, we will dive deeper into Git commands and explore features like staging, committing changes, and viewing commit history. You will also learn about `.gitignore` files and how to use them to exclude files from version control.

- **Topics:**
  - Staging and committing changes
  - Understanding `.gitignore` files
  - Viewing commit history
- **Lab:**
  - Create and use a `.gitignore` file.
  - Commit multiple changes and explore `git log` options.

## Day 3: Branching and Merging

In this lesson, we will cover branching and merging in Git. You will learn how to create, switch, and merge branches, as well as resolve merge conflicts. Branching allows you to work on features independently and merge changes back to the main branch.

- **Topics:**
  - Creating and switching branches
  - Merging branches
  - Resolving merge conflicts
- **Lab:**
  - Create a new branch and switch to it.
  - Make changes in the branch and merge it with the main branch.
- **Challenge:**
  - Simulate a merge conflict and resolve it.
- **Practice:**
  - Create a feature branch and merge it back to the main branch.

## Day 4: Introduction to GitHub

In this lesson, we will introduce GitHub, a popular platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on projects. You will learn how to create a GitHub account, set up a repository, and push your local repository to GitHub. GitHub provides features like pull requests and issues for effective collaboration.

- **Topics:**
  - What is GitHub?
  - Creating a GitHub repository
  - Pushing a local repository to GitHub
- **Lab:**
  - Create a GitHub account.
  - Push your local repository to GitHub.
- **Challenge:**
  - Add a new file locally and push the changes to GitHub.
- **Practice:**
  - Explore the GitHub repository interface.

## Day 5: Collaborating on GitHub

In this lesson, we will cover collaborative workflows on GitHub, including forking repositories, cloning repositories, and submitting pull requests. You will learn how to contribute to open-source projects and review code changes from other collaborators. Effective collaboration is essential for working on projects with multiple team members.

- **Topics:**
  - Forking repositories
  - Cloning repositories
  - Pull requests and code reviews
- **Lab:**
  - Fork a public repository, clone it, and make changes.
  - Submit a pull request.
- **Challenge:**
  - Review a pull request in a collaborative repository.
- **Practice:**
  - Clone a repository and explore its contents.

## Day 6: Advanced Git Features

In this lesson, we will explore advanced Git features like stashing changes, working with tags, and rebasing branches. These features help you manage complex workflows, maintain a clean commit history, and collaborate effectively with other developers.

- **Topics:**
  - Git stash
  - Working with tags
  - Rebasing
- **Lab:**
  - Use `git stash` to temporarily save changes.
  - Create and push a tag to GitHub.
- **Challenge:**
  - Rebase a branch onto the main branch.
- **Practice:**
  - Use `git stash` in a workflow and reapply changes later.

---

## Day 7: Git Workflow Best Practices

In this lesson, we will discuss best practices for using Git in your projects, including feature branch workflows, writing good commit messages, and using Git aliases. These practices help maintain a clean and organized repository, making it easier to collaborate with others and track changes over time.

- **Topics:**
  - Feature branch workflow
  - Writing good commit messages
  - Using Git aliases
- **Lab:**
  - Implement a feature branch workflow for a small project.
  - Create custom Git aliases for frequently used commands.
- **Challenge:**
  - Rewrite a messy commit history using `git rebase -i`.
- **Practice:**
  - Follow best practices for a small project.

## Day 8: Resolving Issues and Debugging

In this lesson, we will cover common Git issues and debugging techniques, including viewing commit differences, checking commit blame, and undoing changes. You will learn how to identify and fix mistakes in your repository, as well as revert changes without losing valuable work.

- **Topics:**
  - Viewing commit differences (`git diff`)
  - Checking commit blame (`git blame`)
  - Undoing changes: `git reset`, `git checkout`, and `git revert`
- **Lab:**
  - Experiment with undoing changes using `git reset` and `git revert`.
  - Use `git blame` to identify changes in a file.
- **Challenge:**
  - Revert a specific commit without affecting others.
- **Practice:**
  - Debug a mistake in a small repository.

## Day 9: GitHub Actions

In this lesson, we will introduce GitHub Actions, a powerful automation tool that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code directly from GitHub. You will learn how to set up workflows, automate tasks like testing and linting, and deploy your projects with GitHub Actions.

- **Topics:**
  - Introduction to CI/CD
  - Setting up GitHub Actions workflows
- **Lab:**
  - Create a simple GitHub Actions workflow to run tests or lint code.
  - Automate deployments with GitHub Actions.
- **Challenge:**
  - Configure a workflow for a sample project that runs tests on every pull request.
- **Practice:**
  - Explore other GitHub Actions templates and use them in your repository.

## Day 10: Deploying and Showcasing Projects

In this lesson, we will cover deploying projects using GitHub Pages, an easy way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. You will also learn about open-source contribution basics, writing a good `README.md`, and showcasing your projects effectively on GitHub.

- **Topics:**
  - Deploying GitHub Pages
  - Open-source contribution basics
  - Writing a good `README.md`
- **Lab:**
  - Deploy a static website using GitHub Pages.
  - Improve the documentation of an existing project.
